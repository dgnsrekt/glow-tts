## Summary

**Total Tasks**: 20
**Total Estimated Hours**: 78-83 hours
**Estimated Duration**: 8-11 days (with parallel work)

### Critical Path
1. Project Setup → Interfaces → Parser → Queue → Piper Engine → Audio Player → Controller → UI Integration

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- Cache and Mock Player (can be done in parallel)
- Google TTS and Fallback Engine (after Piper)
- Documentation and Testing (ongoing)

### Risk Areas
- Audio device compatibility
- Piper subprocess management
- UI responsiveness
- Memory management
