# Ideas Folder

Drop your product ideas, requirements, mockups, and inspiration here!

## Purpose
This folder is for collecting all materials that inform your product vision:
- Product requirements and specifications
- UI/UX mockups and wireframes
- Research notes and competitive analysis
- Technical architecture diagrams
- User stories and personas
- Any other inspiration materials

## Supported Formats
- **Documents**: .md, .pdf, .txt, .doc, .docx
- **Images**: .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .svg, .gif
- **Data**: .json, .yaml, .yml, .csv
- **Code examples**: .py, .js, .ts, .html, .css

## How It Works
When you run product planning or analysis commands, Strategic Core will:
1. Scan all files in this folder
2. Extract key insights and requirements
3. Use them to inform documentation generation
4. Create better aligned product specs

## Commands That Use This Folder
- `/plan-product` - Incorporates ideas when planning new products
- `/analyze-product` - Cross-references ideas with existing codebase

## Tips
- Name files descriptively (e.g., "user-authentication-flow.png")
- Use subfolders to organize related materials
- Include a summary.md if you have many files
- Don't worry about format - just drop your ideas here!

---
*Strategic Core will automatically process these materials to create better documentation.*
