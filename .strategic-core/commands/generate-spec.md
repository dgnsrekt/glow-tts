# /generate-spec

Generate feature specifications from analyzed projects.

## Usage

```
/generate-spec
```

## Description

This command analyzes a project (local or web-based) and generates:
- Feature specifications with technical requirements
- Project overview specifications
- Task breakdowns based on detected patterns

## Process

1. **Source Selection**: Choose a project to analyze
   - Local directory (default: current project)
   - GitHub repository URL
   - Documentation website URL

2. **Analysis**: The system analyzes:
   - Technology stack (languages, frameworks)
   - Code standards and practices
   - Project structure and patterns
   - Dependencies and tools

3. **Spec Generation**: Choose what to generate:
   - **Feature Spec**: Detailed specification for a new feature
   - **Project Overview**: High-level project analysis and structure
   - **Both**: Generate both types

## Generated Specs Include

### Feature Specifications
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- Technical design and architecture
- Implementation guidelines based on detected standards
- Testing strategy
- Task breakdown
- Acceptance criteria

### Project Overview
- Technology stack breakdown
- Directory structure
- Development practices
- Detected standards and patterns
- Entry points and API patterns

## Examples

```bash
# Generate a feature spec for the current project
/generate-spec

# The command will prompt for:
# - Source to analyze (default: current directory)
# - Type of spec to generate
# - Feature details (if generating feature spec)
```

## Output

Specs are saved to `.strategic-core/specs/` with timestamps:
- `20240115_143022_user_authentication.md` (feature spec)
- `project_overview.md` (project overview)

### Path Validation

After generating specs, I'll ensure CLAUDE.md has accurate paths:

```python
# Fix any incorrect paths in CLAUDE.md
from pathlib import Path

claude_md = Path("CLAUDE.md")
if claude_md.exists():
    content = claude_md.read_text()
    original = content

    # Correct common path errors
    content = content.replace(".strategic-core/standards/", ".strategic-core/specs/")
    content = content.replace("@.strategic-core/standards/", "@.strategic-core/specs/")

    if content != original:
        claude_md.write_text(content)
        print("âœ“ Updated CLAUDE.md paths to reflect actual file locations")
```

## Benefits

- Ensures new features follow existing patterns
- Documents technical decisions based on analysis
- Creates consistent specification format
- Saves time on requirements gathering
- Provides clear implementation guidelines
