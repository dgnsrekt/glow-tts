# Simple Git Workflow

> A basic Git workflow for small projects and solo developers
> Perfect for getting started with version control

## Overview

The Simple Git Workflow is designed for:
- Solo developers
- Small teams (1-3 people)
- Projects without complex release cycles
- Learning Git fundamentals

## Basic Workflow

### 1. Initialize Repository
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 2. Daily Development Flow
```bash
# Start your work
git pull origin main  # Get latest changes

# Make changes
# ... edit files ...

# Check what changed
git status
git diff

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature X"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### 3. Commit Guidelines

#### Commit Messages
- Keep it short and descriptive
- Use present tense: "Add feature" not "Added feature"
- Reference issues when relevant: "Fix login bug (#123)"

#### When to Commit
- Commit when a logical unit of work is complete
- Commit before switching context
- Commit at least once per day

### 4. Basic Branching (Optional)

For features that take multiple days:

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-thing

# Work on feature
git add .
git commit -m "Work on new thing"

# Merge back to main
git checkout main
git merge feature/new-thing

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/new-thing
```

## Essential Commands

### Status and History
```bash
git status          # What's changed?
git log --oneline   # See commit history
git diff            # See uncommitted changes
```

### Undoing Changes
```bash
git checkout -- file.txt    # Discard changes to file
git reset HEAD~1           # Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1    # Undo last commit (discard changes)
```

### Working with Remote
```bash
git remote add origin <url>   # Connect to remote
git push -u origin main      # First push
git pull origin main         # Get latest changes
```

## Best Practices

1. **Commit Often**: Small, frequent commits are better than large ones
2. **Write Good Messages**: Future you will thank present you
3. **Pull Before Push**: Always get latest changes before pushing
4. **Don't Commit Secrets**: Never commit passwords, API keys, etc.
5. **Use .gitignore**: Exclude files that shouldn't be tracked

## .gitignore Template

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
vendor/
venv/
.env

# Build outputs
dist/
build/
*.pyc
__pycache__/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Secrets
.env
.env.local
secrets/
```

## Common Issues

### Merge Conflicts
When Git can't automatically merge:

```bash
# 1. Open conflicted file
# 2. Look for conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your changes
=======
Their changes
>>>>>>> branch-name

# 3. Edit to resolve
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Commit the resolution
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

### Forgot to Pull
If you get "rejected" when pushing:

```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve any conflicts
git push origin main
```

## Next Steps

As your project grows, consider:
- [GitHub Flow](./github-flow.md) for team collaboration
- [GitFlow](./gitflow.md) for versioned releases
- Branch protection rules
- Pull request workflows
