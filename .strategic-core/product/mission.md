# Glow-TTS Mission

## Product Vision

Glow-TTS is an enhanced fork of the Glow markdown reader that adds Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality with synchronized sentence-level highlighting. Our mission is to transform terminal-based markdown reading from a visual-only experience into an accessible, multi-modal reading experience suitable for both visual and auditory consumption.

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers & DevOps Engineers**: Technical professionals who regularly consume documentation and README files in terminal environments
- **Terminal Power Users**: Users who prefer multi-tasking while consuming technical content in the terminal

### Secondary Users  
- **Accessibility-Focused Users**: Individuals with visual impairments or reading difficulties who need auditory content consumption
- **Auditory Learners**: Users who prefer or benefit from hearing content while reading

### Tertiary Users
- **Productivity Enthusiasts**: Users who want to consume content while performing other tasks
- **Multi-Modal Learners**: Users who benefit from synchronized visual-auditory information processing

## Core Values and Principles

1. **Accessibility First**: Making terminal-based markdown accessible to all users regardless of visual ability
2. **Non-Invasive Enhancement**: Maintaining Glow's performance and elegance while adding TTS capabilities  
3. **Simplicity**: Intuitive controls with minimal learning curve for existing Glow users
4. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Consistent experience across Linux, macOS, and Windows
5. **Open Source Excellence**: Contributing back to the community with high-quality, maintainable code

## Key Differentiators

- **Terminal-Native TTS**: First markdown reader to offer integrated TTS directly in the terminal
- **Sentence-Level Synchronization**: Precise visual highlighting synchronized with audio playback
- **Dual Engine Support**: Both local (Piper TTS) and cloud-based (Google TTS) options
- **Zero-Friction Integration**: Seamless extension of existing Glow functionality
- **Performance Preservation**: No degradation of Glow's rendering speed during TTS operation

## Success Metrics

### Functional Success
- Synchronized TTS playback with <500ms timing accuracy
- Support for markdown documents up to 10MB without performance issues
- Successful integration with both Piper and Google TTS engines

### Performance Success  
- No more than 10% performance degradation in text rendering during TTS playback
- Audio generation latency <2 seconds for sentences up to 100 words
- Sentence highlighting updates within 100ms of audio timing events

### User Experience Success
- Learning curve <5 minutes for existing Glow users
- Intuitive keyboard controls following media player conventions
- Clear visual feedback for all TTS state changes

### Compatibility Success
- Works across all Glow-supported terminal emulators
- Cross-platform support for Linux, macOS, and Windows
- Maintains compatibility with existing Glow configuration files

## Project Scope

### Core Features
- TTS integration with sentence-level synchronization
- Audio playback controls (play, pause, stop, navigation)
- Visual highlighting of currently spoken sentences
- Keyboard shortcuts for all TTS functions
- Status display for TTS state and position

### Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
- Word-level synchronization
- Audio speed controls (v1.0)
- Audio export functionality
- Multi-document playlist management
- Custom TTS model training

## Long-Term Vision

Glow-TTS aims to become the standard for accessible terminal-based documentation reading, setting a precedent for how terminal applications can integrate multi-modal experiences without compromising performance or usability. We envision a future where all terminal tools consider accessibility as a core feature, not an afterthought.
