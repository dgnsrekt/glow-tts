   - Generates 440Hz tone (A4 note) for audio verification
   - Proper timing simulation for sentences
   - Successfully integrated with audio player

   - Oto audio library integrated
   - Cross-platform audio output working
   - PCM audio format support (16-bit, 44100Hz)
   - Mock engine produces audible output

4. **Fallback System**
   - FallbackEngine wrapper implemented
   - Automatic switching from primary to secondary engine
   - Configurable failure threshold
   - Thread-safe operation with sync.RWMutex

### üöß Partially Working Features

1. **Piper TTS Integration**
   - Piper binary is installed and working
   - Model available (en_US-amy-medium.onnx)
   - Process management code written but failing

2. **Sentence Highlighting**
   - ApplyTTSHighlighting function implemented
