## Commits Made

### 1. Fallback Engine (`327e98d`)

- Process pool management for stability
- Health monitoring and automatic restart
- Fresh process mode support
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. SimpleEngine (`0b6509c`)
- Synchronous Piper execution (avoids race conditions)
- Fresh process per request
- Factory pattern for engine selection
- `PIPER_FRESH_MODE` environment variable support

### 4. Piper Fixes (`222657e`)
- Removed conflicting `--output-file` argument
- Fixed process initialization failures

### 5. Audio Player Fixes (`fd4669d`)
- Prevented channel panic on shutdown
- Added defer recovery for safe channel closing

### 6. UI Improvements (`cead8a1`)
- Yellow indicator for playing sentence (attempted)
- Improved Piper binary discovery
- Rich status display for TTS state
- Better error handling and logging

### 7. TUI Auto-Detection (`7974182`)
- Automatically opens TUI for local markdown files
- No `-t` flag needed in most cases

### 8. Controller Enhancements (`e678342`)
- Added `GetTotalSentences()` method
- Improved mock engine
- Comprehensive integration tests
- Enhanced debug logging

### 9. Documentation Updates (`b6e1e9d`)
- Updated strategic core documentation
- Task tracking and completion status

### 10. Gitignore Updates (`ec39ce3`)
- Added build artifacts and test files

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- TTS toggle (press 't')
- Play/pause functionality (space bar)
- Sentence navigation (comma/period keys)
- Automatic fallback to mock when Piper fails
- TUI auto-detection

### ⚠️ Known Issues
1. **Audio Output**: Still hearing tones instead of real speech
   - Piper process dies immediately
   - Falls back to mock engine
   - SimpleEngine not being selected despite `PIPER_FRESH_MODE`

2. **Visual Issues**:
   - Document appears twice (rendering issue)
   - Yellow indicator not showing
   - Status bar disappears when TTS enabled

3. **Engine Selection**:
   - Factory still selecting V2 instead of SimpleEngine
   - V2's fresh mode is broken
   - Need to ensure SimpleEngine is used with `PIPER_FRESH_MODE=true`

## Testing Instructions

### Quick Test
```bash
# Enable fresh mode for stability
export PIPER_FRESH_MODE=true

# Run with a markdown file
./glow-tts README.md

# Press 't' to enable TTS
# Press space to play
```

### Debug Test
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test script
/tmp/final_test.sh

# Or check logs
tail -f /tmp/glow_tts_debug.log
```

## Next Steps

### High Priority
1. Fix SimpleEngine selection in factory
2. Debug why Piper process dies immediately
3. Fix document duplication issue
4. Make yellow indicator visible

### Medium Priority
1. Fix status bar disappearing
2. Improve sentence highlighting
3. Add word-level synchronization

### Low Priority
1. Add speed controls
2. Add voice selection UI
3. Improve error messages

## Environment Variables

- `PIPER_FRESH_MODE=true` - Use SimpleEngine (one process per request)
- `PIPER_USE_V2=true` - Force V2 engine
- `GLOW_TTS_DEBUG=true` - Enable debug logging

## Debug Notes

The main issue is that Piper is failing to start properly. The logs show:
```
[WARNING TTS] Primary engine initialization failed: failed to start process 0: process died immediately after starting
[WARNING TTS] Using fallback engine due to primary initialization failure
```

This causes the system to fall back to the mock engine, which only produces tones.

The SimpleEngine was created to address this by using synchronous execution and avoiding the stdin race condition, but it's not being selected even with `PIPER_FRESH_MODE=true` due to the factory logic issue.
