# TTS Implementation Notes

## Task 7: Audio Queue with Preprocessing Pipeline - COMPLETED

### What was implemented:

1. **Core TTS Infrastructure** (`pkg/tts/`)
   - `queue.go`: Complete TTSAudioQueue with preprocessing pipeline
     - Lookahead buffer for smooth playback
     - Audio preprocessing (silence trimming, normalization, crossfading)
     - Memory management with lifecycle tracking
     - Worker pool for concurrent synthesis
   - `player.go`: Audio playback system
     - Global audio player singleton
     - PCM audio format support (22050Hz, 16-bit, mono)
     - Proper playback state management
     - Memory lifecycle with finalizers
   - `controller.go`: TTS orchestration
     - Integration of engine, parser, and player
     - Play/Pause/Resume/Stop controls
     - Speed control support

2. **UI Integration** (`ui/`)
   - `tts.go`: Complete TTS state management
     - Initialization with timeout (10 seconds)
     - Status bar rendering with live state
     - Keyboard shortcut handlers
   - `ui.go`: Main UI integration
     - Space key for play/pause
     - Protection against uninitialized state
     - UI refresh mechanism during initialization
   - `pager.go`: Document integration
     - Raw markdown storage for TTS
     - Status bar integration

3. **Configuration**
   - CLI flags: `--tts piper` to enable
   - Environment variable support for voice models
   - Configuration structure in place

### Known Issues Fixed:
- ✅ Audio cutoff (fixed with IsPlaying() detection)
- ✅ Initialization race condition (fixed with state tracking)
- ✅ UI stuck on "Initializing..." (fixed with refresh mechanism)
- ✅ Empty document text (fixed with rawMarkdownText storage)
- ✅ Repeated play commands (fixed with skipChildUpdate)

### Testing Instructions:
```bash
# Build the project
go build -o glow

# Test with Piper TTS
./glow --tts piper README.md

# In the document view:
# - Press Space to play/pause
# - Press S to stop
# - Press +/- to adjust speed
# - Left/Right arrows for sentence navigation (partial implementation)
```

### Implementation Status:
- ✅ Audio queue with preprocessing pipeline
- ✅ Memory management and lifecycle
- ✅ UI integration with status display
- ✅ Initialization with proper error handling
- ✅ Basic playback controls

### Next Steps (Future Tasks):
- Implement sentence-by-sentence navigation
- Add cache management for synthesized audio
- Implement error recovery mechanism
- Add support for additional TTS engines (gtts)
- Enhance preprocessing pipeline with more audio effects
