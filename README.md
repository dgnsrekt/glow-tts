- 🎚️ Speed control (0.5x to 2.0x)
- 💾 Audio caching for repeated content
- 🎵 Sentence-by-sentence navigation
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts in TUI mode

### Keyboard Controls

When TTS is enabled in TUI mode:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause |
| `s` | Stop |

| `↑` | Increase speed |
| `↓` | Decrease speed |
