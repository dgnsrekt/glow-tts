# **Glow-TTS Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Project Name:** Glow-TTS
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** August 8, 2025
**Project Type:** Open Source Fork Enhancement

***

## **1. Project Overview**

### **1.1 Project Summary**

Glow-TTS is a fork of the popular Glow markdown reader that adds Text-to-Speech (TTS) functionality with synchronized sentence-level highlighting. The project transforms Glow from a visual-only markdown reader into an accessible, multi-modal reading experience suitable for both visual and auditory consumption.

### **1.2 Project Goals**

- Extend Glow's existing terminal-based markdown rendering with TTS capabilities
- Provide sentence-level audio-visual synchronization for enhanced reading experience
- Maintain Glow's performance characteristics and terminal compatibility
- Support both Piper TTS (local) and Google TTS (cloud-based) engines
- Create an accessible reading tool for users with visual impairments or reading preferences


### **1.3 Success Metrics**

- **Functional Success:** Synchronized TTS playback with <500ms timing accuracy
- **Performance Success:** No degradation in text rendering performance during TTS playback
- **User Experience Success:** Intuitive controls with minimal learning curve for existing Glow users
- **Compatibility Success:** Works across Linux, macOS, and Windows terminal environments

***

## **2. Background and Context**

### **2.1 Problem Statement**

Terminal-based markdown readers like Glow provide excellent visual experiences but lack accessibility features for users who prefer or require auditory content consumption. Current TTS solutions require switching between applications or lack synchronization with visual content.

### **2.2 User Personas**

**Primary Persona: Technical Documentation Consumer**

- Software developers and DevOps engineers
- Regular terminal users who read documentation and README files
- Users who prefer multi-tasking while consuming technical content

**Secondary Persona: Accessibility-Focused User**

- Users with visual impairments or reading difficulties
- Users who prefer auditory learning styles
- Users in situations where visual reading is impractical

**Tertiary Persona: Productivity Enthusiast**

- Users who want to consume content while performing other tasks
- Users who prefer synchronized visual-auditory information processing


### **2.3 Current State Analysis**

- **Existing Solution:** Glow provides excellent visual markdown rendering in terminal
- **Gap:** No built-in audio capabilities or accessibility features
- **Opportunity:** Leverage existing Glow architecture for seamless TTS integration
